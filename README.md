Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks for web designers, and its eagerly awaited version 4 just launched! In this course, which was originally recorded as a live stream, Adi Purdila will build a responsive landing page while discussing what’s new, what’s improved, how to get things up and running, whilst also answering some questions from the viewers along the way.
